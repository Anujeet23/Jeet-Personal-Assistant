Subject: Resignation from Airbnb

Dear [Boss Name],

I am writing to inform you that I am resigning from my role at Airbnb, effective [date].

I have thoroughly enjoyed my time working at Airbnb and I am grateful for the opportunities I have been given here. I have learnt a lot and have been incredibly well supported since I joined.

I am confident that the team is now in a great position and is well-equipped to move forward without me. I will make sure to wrap up any projects I am currently working on before leaving and I am happy to answer any questions or provide any assistance or training that may be needed.

I wish you and the team all the best for the future.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
